# GANs playground project on Kaggle

Kaggle Playground Competition ([Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started))

Project for Deep Learning at CU Boulder

This notebook can be runned only on Kaggle.


The chosen architecture is a CycleGAN, employing a UNET structure for the generator. Encoder and decoder layers are defined for both the generator and discriminator. The discriminator utilizes instance normalization, and the generator employs skip connections to address the vanishing gradient problem. 

The analysis section encompasses reasoning behind successful outcomes, explanations for model performance, and discussions on hyperparameter optimization.
